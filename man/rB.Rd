\title{rB}
\usage{
rB(data, method = "annual")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Consecutive biomass index data (e.g., CPUE values). Data must be in descending order, with the most recent value first.}

\item{method}{The calculation method (\code{"annual"}, \code{"1over2"}, or \code{"2over3"}). Default is \code{"annual"}.}
}
\value{
The proportional rate of change in the biomass index. A positive \code{rB} indicates an increase in the biomass index, while a negative \code{rB} indicates a decrease.
}
\description{
This function calculates the proportional rate of change in a biomass index (rB) between consecutive data points using one of three available methods.
\describe{
\item{\code{annual}}{Calculates the proportional rate of change between two consecutive data points.}
\item{\verb{1over2}}{Calculates the proportional rate of change by comparing the most recent data point to the average of the next two data points.}
\item{\verb{2over3}}{Calculates the proportional rate of change using the average of the first two data points, compared to the average of the next three data points.}
}
}
\examples{
biomass <- c(100, 120, 110, 130, 140)
rB(biomass, method = "annual")
rB(biomass, method = "1over2")
rB(biomass, method = "2over3")
